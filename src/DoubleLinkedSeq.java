* This class is a homework assignment;
* A DoubleLinkedSeq</CODE> is a collection of double</CODE> numbers.
* The sequence can have a special "current element," which is specified and 
* accessed through four methods that are not available in the sequence class 
* (start, getCurrent, advance and isCurrent).
